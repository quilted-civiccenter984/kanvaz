# Changelog

All notable changes to Kanvaz are documented here.

## [2.0.1] — Final release
- Identity update: now made by Atharva Patil (Northbyte Studios).
- Updated docs and in-app About screen to reflect final-release status.

## [2.0.0] — Final release
- Declared feature-complete. No further development planned.
- README and overview PDF updated to mention audio card support.
- Removed leftover debug logging.

## [1.1.3]
- Fixed: pressing **P** to pin/unpin a card could show two conflicting
  toasts ("Card pinned" / "Card unpinned") at once.
- Fixed: **Ctrl+D** could create 3 cards total instead of 2 (duplicate
  fired twice from a single press).
- Added a key-repeat guard so holding down a shortcut key (Ctrl+D, P,
  Ctrl+S, etc.) fires the action once, not repeatedly. Arrow-key nudging
  still repeats while held, as expected.

## [1.1.2]
- Bigger, higher-contrast resize handles on cards.
- Replaced the annotation toolbar's text icons with proper SVG icons.
- Cleaned up the visual style of selected/pinned cards, board tabs, and
  the toolbar.
- Improved note placeholder text contrast.

## [1.1.1]
- Internal audit and bug-fix pass: smoother file loading, fixed an issue
  where resizing an annotated card could erase the annotation, fixed a
  memory leak when switching boards with annotations active, fixed
  several edge cases around closing/saving boards, and reduced undo
  history memory usage.

## [1.1.0]
- Added audio card support (MP3, WAV, OGG, M4A) with play/pause, seek,
  mute, and a visible scrub bar.

## [1.0.1]
- Added a "Save changes before closing?" prompt when closing with
  unsaved work.
- Fixed the crash-recovery "Restore" button.

## [1.0.0]
- Initial release: infinite pan/zoom canvas, image/GIF/video cards,
  drawing/annotation tools, multiple boards, undo/redo, minimap,
  settings, and "mood lock" presentation mode.
